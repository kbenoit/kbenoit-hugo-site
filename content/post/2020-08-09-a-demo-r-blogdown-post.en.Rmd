Quanteda is an R package for managing and analyzing text (https://quanteda.io/). One benefit of using quanteda is its powerful plot tools. You can easily plot a keyness graph for a set of documents, i.e. a corpus.

Here, we will use quanteda's build-in corpus, the *inaugural address corpus* to demonstrate how to plot a keyness graph.

**Step 1:** load quanteda package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library("quanteda")
```

**Step 2:** create a dfm (Document features matrix) by tokenize the corpus.

```{r}
my_tokens <- tokens(data_corpus_inaugural, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE)
my_dfm <- dfm(my_tokens, remove=stopwords(language = "en"))
```

**Step 3:** we use that dfm to create a keyness object.

```{r}
my_keyness <- textstat_keyness(my_dfm)
```

**Step 4:** finally, we plot the keyness object.

```{r}
textplot_keyness(my_keyness)
```

There many more options for the plot. Please refer to [textplot_wordcloud](https://quanteda.io/reference/textplot_keyness.html) for more details.
